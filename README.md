# Computing-GCD-of-Two-Numbers-Using-Datapath-and-Control-Design
Using the Datapath and Control Design approach, I made a system to calculate the GCD of two numbers.
This is an example that was given in the NPTEL course 'Hardware Modeling Using Verilog' by Prof. Indranil Sengupta.

This is the simulation result.
